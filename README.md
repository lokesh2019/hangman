## Rules of the game
<p>
    Mr. Stickson is our best friend. He has been falsely accused of a serious crime and the
    evil judge has sentenced him to be hanged. The evil judge has agreed to release Mr. 
    Stickson if you can guess a random word decided by the judge before Mr. Stickson is
    hanged. His life is in your hands.. Good luck!
</p>
<p>
    The game begins by presenting the player empty boxes - one for each letter in the
    mystery word. Player guesses the letter by selecting a letter on the keyboard on screen.
    If the guessed letter exists in the word, the game reveals the position of that letter.
</p>
<p>
    If the player selects a letter that is not in the word, i.e. makes an incorrect guess,
    the game starts drawing a hanging man - one wrong guess at a time. After ten wrong
    guesses, the picture completes with a hanging man (hence the name hangman) and the 
    game is over.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the purpose of the game is to guess the word correctly before Mr. Stickman
    is hanged.

<p>
    Press the RESET button at the bottom of the screen in the "PLAY GAME" tab to reset the game
    at any point. A new random word will be selected and the game will restart.
